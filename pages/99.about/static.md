*Pop!* aims to be a ‘small-batch, handcrafted’ journal that puts its community first, that wants to be read, and that makes care a priority: care for its content, care for its audience, and care for the kind of world it wants to serve.

*Pop!* is rooted in the humanities, but spans a variety of disciplines and is purposefully structured to be open to varieties of intellectual engagement. *Pop!* includes editorials, conference proceedings, articles, book and event reviews, interviews, and research features. It showcases peer reviewed scholarly articles, but also an array of shorter updates on projects and people interesting to our community, as curated by *Pop’s* interdisciplinary editorial board (listed below).

*Pop* is published at Simon Fraser University by the [Canadian Institute for Studies in Publishing](https://publishing.sfu.ca)

*Pop!* is blind peer-reviewed by members of our scholarly community, who evaluate each article for its originality, coherence, scholarship, and for its readability, not just for specialist audiences within the university, but for broader interested audiences.

## A Pop! Manifesto

The scholarly journal has, in the twenty-first century, effectively been scaled-up to inhuman levels. The corporate machinery of the Elseviers and Springers of the world—not to mention the global ambitions of the Open Access movement—have served to transform the journal, and the article, from the mechanism of scholarly communication—how actual scholars communicate with their peers—into a massive planet-wide engine—with huge economies of scale and increasingly run by algorithms and AI—that no longer operates at human scale. When we write journal articles, we are literally writing for machines.

Perhaps, in the sciences, this is reasonable, and appropriate. The global scientific project is based on a rapid cumulative tradition based on the circulation of *results*, and as such a colossal automated engine perhaps serves humanity well enough—or at least could, in a fairer open-access version of itself. But this scale cannot be right for the humanities. What can it mean for the humanities if we are indeed writing for machines instead of each other?

We thought about what is good about the idea of a *journal*: that it can be the embodiment of a community of interest, that it serves as a preservation medium for its content, and that it has various affordances for the circulation of ideas through its immediate community and hopefully beyond. These qualities were served for hundreds of years by the technology of print.

But print has largely been supplanted in scholarly communications over the past generation, in favour of the relatively costless, frictionless, borderless exchange of ideas over the Internet. And indeed, the Internet has been hugely successful in making it possible for articles and journals to find global audiences, and in some cases to speed up the circulation of ideas. But it has also led to the pursuit of inhuman scale, to a fetishizing of metrics, and, frankly, to a crisis of economics in which, shorn of subscription fees, no one—other than the large entrenched corporate interests—has been able to figure out how to elegants fund OA publications.

Perhaps, in some cases, print was still a good idea. Perhaps in the humanities, where we might make a virtue of smaller, more human scale, and where we might hope that virtues other than impact factors, atmetric scores, and h-indexes are the name of the game; virtues like interest, engagement, durability, and even beauty.

Hence the current idea: the "keepsake journal," insprired by modern lifestyle magazines. The journal is published twice a year, in small quanities that are sold (via patreon, kickstarter, etc) to a loyal audience which meshes well with our scholarly community. It features peer-reviewed articles from our scholarly communities, as well as departments and smaller pieces  that explore and document ideas in public scholarship.

In print, the circulation of the magazine is exceeded by its readership, because, as all magazine publishers know, print magazines get passed around and shared. They are left behind and showcased in unusual locations. All of this is unpredictable, and all of this is deliciously hard to measure. But it is charming, and interesting, and appropriate to a truly human mode of inquiry.

And of course the journal exists online, and with its content freely accessible, linkable, and shareable. That part is easy. The magic is in the combination of the two, and how they act, in concert, as vehicles for the circulation of ideas among scholars, and in wider and less predictable circles.
